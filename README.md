# End-To-End Pipeline
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline under development by CMU Africa's Data Science club.

The purpose is to provide a framework that can be applied to multiple ML problems from data exploration, through model building, and on to testing, evaluation and deployment.

### The Data
The data used in this project is from a dataset of invoice data from Tunisia for Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption, which is freely available on [Zindi.africa](https://zindi.africa) via [this](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai-hack-tunisia-4-predictive-analytics-challenge-1) learning competition.
You may join the competition to download the data.

### Scope
This project covers 5 topic areas:
1. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Ensemble Models
3. Artificial Neural Network Models
4. Local Deployment
5. Deployment to the Cloud
